# emerge watchtower for gentoo systems

## intended for use with slstatus or any other bar with script support

## c port is in active development. this is a temporary solution.
## please use gentoo-perl/genlop for advanced emerge monitoring.
## cwatch is not intended to replace, but rather simplify and clean up genlop.
